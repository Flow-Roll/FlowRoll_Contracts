# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
âœ… When On-Chain Gambling Is DeFi:
It is non-custodial (users control their funds via smart contracts).

It operates on decentralized infrastructure (e.g. Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana).

The logic is enforced by public smart contracts, not a central operator.

Payouts are automatic and transparent.

Often includes DeFi-like mechanics, such as staking, LP rewards, or token governance.
